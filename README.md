Sneakers Ecommerce website frontend.

This frontend was created using html, css, and js. I created this when I was learning about web development from youtube.

The website is a sneakers store that currently displays 5 products which the users can know the details about. 

Here is a screenshot of what the website looks like: <br>

If you want experience this for yourself, you can do so by downloading the code and running the website on your browser using the Live Server extension. For those of you who don't know about Live Server, it is an extension which can be downloaded inside of Vscode.

This is what your bottom bar of vscode will look like if you have suceesfully installed the extension. Now all you have to do is click on Go Live and your website will be launched on your browser.
